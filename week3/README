# Here are the basic steps to get this repo working

1. Change names and values in group_vars/all/main.yml as appropriate to your organization.

2. Copy/Edit the launchCluster.sh script to suit your region

3. Install ansible: sudo pip install ansible

4. Install boto 3: sudo pip install --ignore-installed six boto3

5. Make sure you have an ec2 key in the region you're targeting:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html

6. Add your keyfile.pem to your local ssh-agent:
ssh-add /path/to/<keyfile>.pem

7. Use ansible-vault to create the vault file:
ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault

You need to define the variables below in the group_vars/all/vault file:
All password hashes should be generated with: mkpasswd --method=SHA-512
your pub_key can usually be found by: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
-------------------------------------------
aws_access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
aws_secret_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
keypair: mykepair

webmin_user: webmin
webmin_passwd: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Users are in a dictionary structure like so
my_users:
  user1:
    group: "admin"
    shell: "/bin/bash"
    passwd: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    vpn_phrase: "TheVPNPassPhrase"
    pub_key:  ssh-rsa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  user2:
    group: "wheel"
    shell: "/bin/bash"
    passwd: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    vpn_phrase: "AnotherVPNPassPhrase"
    pub_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

-------------------------------------------
pub_key is the user's id_rsa.pub file. Just paste the whole contents of that file after pub_key:

8. add the vault password you used in step 3 to ~/.vault_pass.txt. chmod 600 ~/.vault_pass.txt
better still, encrypt your ansible vault password with gpg:
http://benincosa.com/?p=3235

9. Accept the license agreement for the amazon ecs optimized ami:
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U6QTYI2

10. From the repo root: ./launchCluster.sh
